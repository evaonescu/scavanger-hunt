    <p>Beginning in the late 1930’s, the arcade gaming scene became a hit by the late 60’s. During the 70’s, arcade games were loved by adults and children alike, and even restaurants started adding coin-operated machines on their premises. &nbsp;</p>
	  
    <p>In front of you is a Defender Arcade Machine developed by Williams Electronics in 1980, so more than 40 years ago! Its creator, Eugene Jarvis, admits that he faced skepticism from his management team. Most games of the era featured at most a few buttons and a joystick, and this is why people were afraid of this game at first - “I guess it was all the buttons” says Jarvis. The public managed to overcome their hesitation, and Defender became not only Williams’ best-selling game with over 55,000 units sold, but also a statement for the golden age of arcade video games. Up to this day, Defender remains one of the most difficult games to have ever been created.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Take a picture of the arcade to complete the Scavenger Hunt!&nbsp;</p>
